## Projects
### Application of deep learning in TCT (thinprep cytologic test)
 - Medical image quality inspection using binary classifiers like ResNet50 or Xception.
 - Positive cells detection using object detectors like YoloV3 or FastRCNN.
 - Detected cells classification using classifiers like ResNet50 or Xception.
 - Neuclies detection using segmentors like UNet.
 - Overall TCT diagnosis, based on the statistics of cells and DNA contents, using classifiers like SVM or XGBoost.
 
### Application of deep learning in TMB (tumor mutation burdon) prediction of immunotherapy
 - correlation of TMB counts with features of WSIs (whole slide images), via an encoder-decoder approach.
